# Motion-Control-Data-Analysis

This repository contains the python scripts used for data parsing and analysis in the Motion-Control project (repo here: https://github.com/Michaelszeng/Motion-Control)

There are just 2 example files which contain the robot's telemetry which is parsed by the TelemetryAnalysis.py script:
 - "data_official_v_turn_1.py" 
 - "TelemetryData_SimplePIDTest.py"
 
 MotionProfiles.py runs without reading data from external python files.
